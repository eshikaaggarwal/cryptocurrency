						<h6><strong> Overview:</strong> As Supreme Court lifts up the ban on Cryptocurrencies, it becomes very important and vital for a UPSC aspirant to know and understand the world of Bitcoins how it evolved and their story so far. </h6>

						<h2>Module 1: Evolution of Cryptocurrency</h2>
						<h6>With the changing times, there has been a paradigm shift in the mode of transactions too. Begin with, there was Barter system, then came the Coins and Currencies and then Cryptocurrencies. </h6>

						<ol>
							<li>Barter system had many disadvantages:</li>
							<ul>
								<li>
								The needs of both parties needed to be overlapped</li>
								<li>No intrinsic/declared value of goods that are to be bartered</li>
								<li>Carrying goods from one place to another was difficult.

								</li>
							</ul>

							<li><strong>Coins/currency system:</strong> Despite its many advantages in present day, there are multiple disadvantages as well:</li>

							<ul class="less">
								<li>
								Centralised regulation which is prone to manipulation.</li>
								<li>Vulnerable to theft, hacking, etc.</li>
								<li>Timing limitations/amount ceiling, etc. in transactions.

								</li>
							</ul>
							<p>To overcome these issues, in 2009 Bitcoins, a type of cryptocurrency came into picture.</p>

							<li><strong>Cryptocurrency:</strong> Though a lot has been said against them, but here are some advantages on a positive note:</li>
							<ul class="less">
								<li>
								Almost impossible to hack the network.</li>
								<li>As the ledger is distributed, thereâ€™s no scope for manipulation.</li>
								<li>Foolproof with regards to theft, etc.

								</li>
								<li>These are not time bound and there is no limit of transacting through them.</li>
							</ul>
							<p class="margin">After understanding the evolution, let us now study basics of cryptocurrency .</p>

						<h5>Two main features of cryptocurrency will help understand its nature:</h5>

						<ul>
							<li><strong>Digital money:</strong> No physical coins/currency.</li>
							<li><strong>Not pegged with any valuables:</strong> Cryptocurrency is standalone and not pegged with anything in real world. This also makes their value fluctuate erratically.

					<div class="crypto">
						<h6>P2P Network</h6>
						<ul>
							<li>Peer-to-peer network is decentralized and interconnected network of different users/operators /nodes.</li>
							<li>Unlike traditional networks peers in block chain are not interconnected via central body, but are directly linked with each other.</li>
							<li>All peers agree upon a common protocol regarding interaction with each other.</li>
							<li><img src="assets/images/hexagon.png"></li>
							<li>Each individual user in network is called node.</li>

				<div class="col-md-4">
					<div class="crypto">
						<h6>DLT</h6>
						<ul>
							<li>It is a distributed ledger technology.</li>
							<li>Unlike traditional ledger, which is centrally maintained, DLT has all its records with all nodes in network. Any manipulation in ledger can be easily detected by other nodes by cross-referencing historical data.</li>
							<li>DLT makes blockchain transparent and tamper-proof.</li>
						</ul>
					</div>

				<div class="col-md-4">
					<div class="crypto">
						<h6>Hashing</h6>
						<ul>
							<li>It is basically a method of encryption of data in block.</li>
							<li>It ensures that the data remains safe and can be accessed by only those having valid public and private key.</li>
							<li>If A sends some message to B, then B can access it only by own private key and A's public key.</li>

						<ul>
							<li>When there is need to reduce intermediaries: Blockchain can help to smoothen out the process when multiple actors have to interact with each other.</li>

							<li>When Digital assets are available: The area where blockchain is to be deployed need to have digital records, assets, e.g. Digital Aadhaar data, etc.</li>

							<li>When interacting parties are in consensus: Domain where multiple parties interacting cannot come to consensus, are not conducive for the use of blockchain.

						<h3>IMCâ€™s Report</h3>
						<h5>Cryptocurrency and blockchain are completely different and blockchain can have many potential uses. Personal Data Protection Bill may be revisited so that it can accommodate cross-border utilities of Distributed Ledger Technology.</h5>

						<h5>IMC recommended draft bill- â€˜Banning of cryptocurrency and regulation of official Digital Currency Bill 2019â€™. It proposes criminal penalty on all activities related to cryptocurrency-mining, holding, selling, dealing, transfer etc.
						</h5>

						<h5>The IMC's Report Proposes complete ban on private cryptocurrencies. The reasons for ban are as follows:</h5>

						<ul>
							<li>It lacks intrinsic value.</li>
							<li>Prone to fluctuations.</li>
							<li>Vulnerable to money-laundering.</li>
							<li>Susceptible to fraud given the low level of digital literacy in the country.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</div>

					<div class="sub_head">
						<h5>RBI Circular Banning Cryptocurrency</h5>
						<ul>
							<li>Cryptocurrency is highly speculative demonstrated by its frequent and high fluctuation in value. </li>
							<li>There is high risk of it being used in terror financing money-laundering.</li> 
							<li>Consumers are at high risk due to lack of knowledge of complex technologies underlying cryptos making consumers vulnerable.</li> 
							<li>Commercial banks, and therefore, economy may be seriously disrupted because of widespread use of cryptocurrency.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</div>

					<div class="sub_head">
						<h5>Supreme Court's decision on RBI's Circular</h5>
						<h6>IAMAI (Internet and Mobile Association of India) challenged RBI's circular in supreme court on mainly two grounds:</h6>
						<ul>
							<li>RBI has no jurisdiction over trading activity</li>
							<li>These assets are to be classified as commodities and not currency.

							</li>
						</ul>

						<h6>Supreme Court quashed RBI's circular and ruled in favour of IAMAI on following grounds:</h6>

						<ul>
							<li>Complete prohibition is excessive and disproportionate measure by RBI.</li>
							<li>RBI did not prove factually the harm cryptos may pose to banks.</li>
							<li>Crypto transactions do not operate in vacuum, but already many laws like PMLA, It Act, FEMA etc. are applicable.</li>
							<li>Article 1g (1) (g) of constitution guarantees freedom to carry on trade. The ban by RBI violates this fundamental right of Indians and therefore the ban is unconstitutional.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</div>

					<div class="box">
						<h5>Cryptocurrency and regulation of official Digital Currency Bill 2021</h5>
						<h6>The bill proposes to ban cryptocurrency completely and intends to launch official digital currency regulated by RBI, i.e. CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency).</h6>

						<h2>Module 5: Way Forward</h2>

						<h6>There are different streams of opinions with respect to regulating cryptocurrency. While outright ban may not solve the problem, unregulated territory will also be dangerous.</h6>

						<ul>
							<li>Launching of CBDC (Central bank digital currency) will automatically encourage majority to opt for CBDC instead of private cryptos.</li>

							<li>Outrightly criminalizing the dealing in cryptos may lead this market going under the carpet, and it will pose a serious threat.</li>

							<li>Instead, stringent regulations on cryptos exchanges may help,
							e.g., these exchanges may be made reporting agencies under PMLA, just like banks.</li>

							<li>Software, Internet and Fintech are Indiaâ€™s major fortress. Cryptos are mainly combination of these three. Therefore, better regulation can help India to benefit from cryptos.</li>

							<li>The issue can be taken up on international forum, like BIS (Bank for International settlement), WTO, etc. Common global solution can help curb any illegal dealings using cryptos.</li>

							<li>Coordinated efforts of different agencies â€“ RBI, SEBI, ED, IRDAI, IBA â€“ is very crucial in managing the new territory of cryptocurrency.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</div>

					<div class="para">
						<p>In conclusion, we can say that cryptocurrency certainly opens up new territory and potential opportunities in every field. India must not loose this opportunity and being a leader in IT and software, must seize it.</p> 

						<p>Therefore, rather than outright ban, we must think of accommodating this new currency so that it can aid and boost our economy.
